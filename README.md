# Opera-GX---Extensions-persos
My custom extensions for Opera GX / Chrome / Chromium (same engine)

1 - Download "Opera-GX---Extensions-persos-main", unzip it on your disk.
2 - Go to the "Extensions" tab, then click on "Developer mode", then "Load un-packaged extension", and select the "NoShortYt" repository from your disk, located in the repository you just unzipped.
3 - Have fun !!
